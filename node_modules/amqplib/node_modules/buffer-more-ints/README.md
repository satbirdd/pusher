# buffer-more-ints: Add support for more integer widths to Buffer

Node's Buffer only supports reading and writing integers of a limited
range of widths.  This module extends Buffer with support for more
widths, so that integers from 1 to 8 bytes (64 bits) can be accessed.
The functions provided follow the same naming conventions and take the
same arguments as the standard ones on Buffer:

    $ node
    > require('buffer-more-ints')
    {}
    > new Buffer("0000deadbeef0000", "hex").readInt64BE(0).toString(16)
    'deadbeef0000'

buffer-more-ints also adds functions `readIntBE`, `writeIntBE`, and
their LE and UInt counterparts, which take an initial argument giving
the width of the integer in bytes:

    > var b = new Buffer(3);
    > b.writeIntLE(3, -123456, 0);
    > b.toString('hex')
    'c01dfe'
    > b.readIntLE(3, 0);
    -123456

The functions added by buffer-more-ints are all implemented in terms
of the core Buffer functions.  Part way through writing the code, I
discovered that node.js currently implements those in JavaScript, so
this doesn't lead to performance benefits.  But should node ever
switch to implementing its Buffer operations natively, this
module should get a speed boost.

## Limitations

As JavaScript uses IEEE754 doubles for numbers, the contiguous range
of integers it can represent is [-2^53 - 1, 2^53 - 1].  So only
integer widths up to 6 bytes or 48 bits can be read exactly.  Reads of
7 or 8 bytes (56 or 64 bits) will return the closest value that can be
represented as a JavaScript number.

In certain situations it might be important to check that a JavaScript
number was read exactly.  The `Buffer.isContiguousInt` function will
determine this:

    > Buffer.isContiguousInt(0x1fffffffffffff);
    true
    > Buffer.isContiguousInt(0x20000000000000);
    false

And `Buffer.assertContiguousInt` asserts that a number is so:

    > Buffer.assertContiguousInt(0x1fffffffffffff);
    undefined
    > Buffer.assertContiguousInt(0x20000000000000);
    AssertionError: number cannot be represented as a contiguous integer
